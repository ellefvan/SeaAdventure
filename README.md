# SeaAdventure
Small Phaser 3 Game

A game created user Phaser 3. Contains a title scene, instruction scene, game scene and music. The fish eats the bubbles until it eats a red bubble and dies. These files need to be hosted on a server to work. (I copied them into its own directory from a directory and server I created using Express. I believe I remembered to copy all of the necessary files.)
